                        <h3>The Marathon Journey</h3>
                        <p>Our journey to Belgium was an absolute marathon. We had to wake up at around 5:00 AM in Hagenberg to get everything ready and start the long trek. We first jumped on a bus from Hagenberg that took us to Linz HBF. From Linz, we caught a train heading to Frankfurt, and from there, we transferred to another train that took us across the border to Brussels. Finally, we took one last train to get to our destination in Hasselt.</p>

                        <p>In total, the entire journey took approximately 14 hours. By the time we reached Hasselt, we were completely exhausted, but it was fascinating to watch the landscape transform as we moved across Europe by rail—from the Austrian Alps through German countryside to the flat plains of Belgium.</p>

                        <h3>First Impressions: Chaos in Brussels Train Station</h3>
                        <p>My first real impression of Belgium was a bit of a shock. While we were in the Brussels train station trying to get onto our connecting train, a random fistfight broke out right in front of us. To be honest, the fight seemed like it was over absolutely nothing, just two people going at it in the middle of the station during what should have been a routine transfer.</p>

                        <p>The situation ended as quickly as it started; as soon as the conductor screamed "Police!", both individuals stopped immediately and ran off in opposite directions. However, the aftermath was quite sad to see. The train immediately pulled out of the station, even though it was actually ahead of schedule.</p>

                        <p>Because of the chaos and the early departure, we saw a family get split up—some made it on and others didn't. The staff didn't allow anyone else onto the platform or the train after the fight began, so we were stuck waiting for the next one. It was a chaotic and strange introduction to the country, but it's definitely a memory that sticks out.</p>

                        <p>Despite this rocky start, we eventually made it to Hasselt where we would spend the next three weeks focused on AI and machine learning. The contrast between the chaotic arrival and the methodical, analytical work we were about to undertake couldn't have been more striking.</p>

                                <h2>Week 1 in Belgium:</h2>
                                <p>We kicked off the Belgium phase with an intensive focus on the technical side of the project, specifically looking at how AI could be applied to environmental issues. We started with an introduction to Python for AI, which was essential since we would be building our own models from scratch. A major part of the week was spent on Time-series Analysis and Neural Networks, giving us the mathematical and logical framework needed to process the constant stream of data coming from the dam sensors.</p>

                                <p>We also had in-depth discussions about the Ethics of AI. This helped us think critically about how automated systems are designed and the responsibility we have to ensure the data is used fairly and transparently. This was the first time I had to think about how the math I knew actually translated into code. Learning about the ethics of AI made me realize that technical success isn't the only goal; the impact on the community and stakeholders matters just as much.</p>

                                <p>Outside of class, the first week was about getting to know the region and bonding as a group. We spent time in Brussels, exploring the city landmarks and soaking in the atmosphere. We also visited a microbrewery in Hasselt to see how local industries operate. One of the best experiences was driving to Eindhoven for the Glow festival. We spent the night walking through the city, seeing how massive light art installations were integrated into the buildings and streets, which was a great way to start the trip.</p>

                                <p>This week highlighted how different teaching and cultural environments can influence learning and teamwork. The Belgian approach to AI education emphasized both technical rigor and ethical considerations, which encouraged me to take more holistic view of system design.</p>

                                <h2>Week 2 in Belgium:</h2>
                                <p>In the second week, the work got more specialized as we moved into Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision. The Computer Vision part was especially important because it gave us the tools to eventually analyze satellite imagery for the project. We also covered deployment, which taught us how to actually take a model out of a testing environment and make it functional for a user.</p>

                                <p>A big part of the week was Assignment 1, where we worked on our own to create three different machine learning models. This was a significant step because it forced us to apply everything we had learned about Python and neural networks in a practical way. My task was to take the theoretical concepts we learned and implement them into functional code for the assignment. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting the models, ensuring the layers of the neural networks were configured correctly and that the data was being processed accurately.</p>

                                <p>This week highlighted the importance of practical validation. You can understand the theory, but you don't really know it until you've spent hours debugging the code and seeing the results. I successfully built the three models, which gave me a much clearer understanding of how machine learning tools support data analysis.</p>

                                <p>For our weekend out of class, we traveled to Brugge. We did a full walking tour of the city, checking out the historic architecture and the canals. While we were there, we made sure to try some authentic Belgian waffles and even caught a local football match to see the local sports culture. We ended the weekend in Knokke, staying at Josie's place, which gave us a bit of a break before the heavy workload of the final week.</p>

                                <h2>Week 3 in Belgium:</h2>
                                <p>The third week was almost entirely dedicated to getting our final projects ready. We focused on bringing together different data sources to solve the hyacinth problem on the dam. We built a multi-layered system: the first model used satellite images to predict the probability of hyacinth coverage, and the second model used historical sensor data to look for patterns. Finally, we created a third model that took inputs from the first two, along with current weather data, to determine for sure if a specific zone would be covered.</p>

                                <p>I felt a lot of pressure to make sure the historical sensor model I was responsible for worked perfectly with the other group members' components. The collaboration went very well, especially the way we used a linear approach to combine different models. However, we definitely felt the time pressure toward the end.</p>

                                <p>This week showed me how adaptable analytical models need to be depending on the context and the type of data available. We successfully completed the project, and seeing all the different models come together into one final prediction was a great way to end the module.</p>

                                <p>Outside of the classroom, we visited the Christmas Winterland park in Hasselt and the Japanese Garden. Even though we were busy, we spent a lot of our free time together as a group working through the project's technical hurdles. Interestingly, to decompress after the long hours of coding, we managed to watch all four seasons of Stranger Things over the course of our three weeks in Belgium.</p>

                                <p>The rest of the week was spent refining these models and preparing our final presentations to show the results of our three weeks of work. For future projects, I would allocate even more time for the final "cleanup" and refinement of the outputs to reduce that last-minute stress.</p>

                            This was the first time I had to think about how the math I knew actually translated into code. Learning about the ethics of AI made me realize that technical success isn't the only goal; the impact on the community and stakeholders matters just as much.</p>

                            <p><strong>Now What?</strong><br>
                            - I plan to focus more on the design of these systems, keeping real-world constraints and ethical guidelines in mind from the very start of the development process.<br>
                            - The Belgian approach to education, which balances technical rigor with ethical considerations, has inspired me to adopt a more holistic approach to problem-solving.<br>
                            - Working in Brussels, the heart of European institutions, has given me a broader perspective on how technology intersects with policy and governance.</p>

                            <h3>Week 2 — STARR Reflection:</h3>
                            <p><strong>Situation:</strong><br>
                            We had to move into complex topics like Computer Vision while simultaneously completing a major assignment where we had to build three separate ML models.</p>

                            <p><strong>Task:</strong><br>
                            My task was to take the theoretical concepts we learned and implement them into functional code for the assignment.</p>

                            <p><strong>Action:</strong><br>
                            I spent a lot of time troubleshooting the models, ensuring the layers of the neural networks were configured correctly and that the data was being processed accurately.</p>

                            <p><strong>Result:</strong><br>
                            I successfully built the three models, which gave me a much clearer understanding of how machine learning tools support data analysis.</p>

                            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br>
                            This week highlighted the importance of practical validation. You can understand the theory, but you don't really know it until you've spent hours debugging the code and seeing the results. The experience also taught me the value of systematic testing and validation in AI development.</p>

                            <h3>Week 3 — John's Model of Structured Reflection:</h3>
                            <p><strong>Description:</strong><br>
                            We spent the week finalizing our integrated model that combined satellite, sensor, and weather data, ending with a final presentation.</p>

                            <p><strong>Feelings:</strong><br>
                            I felt a lot of pressure to make sure the historical sensor model I was responsible for worked perfectly with the other group members' components. There was also excitement about seeing our complete system come together.</p>

                            <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong><br>
                            What went well: The collaboration went very well, especially the way we used a linear approach to combine different models. Our multi-layered system effectively integrated satellite imagery, sensor data, and weather information.<br>
                            What didn't go so well: We definitely felt the time pressure toward the end, and some aspects of model refinement had to be rushed.</p>

                            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong><br>
                            This week showed me how adaptable analytical models need to be depending on the context and the type of data available. The process of integrating different data sources taught me valuable lessons about data compatibility and model interoperability.</p>

                            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
                            We successfully completed the project, and seeing all the different models come together into one final prediction was a great way to end the module. The experience solidified my understanding of end-to-end AI system design.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h2>Intercultural Competencies:</h2>
                        <p>The Netherlands has a culture that is very structured and task oriented. People tend to follow schedules closely, stick to clear roles, and focus on efficiency and precision. Meetings are usually short and to the point, and work is approached with careful planning. Spontaneous ideas and informal social interaction are less common during work time, as the priority is on completing tasks effectively.</p>

                        <p>In Spain, the culture is more relaxed and social. People take time to connect personally and enjoy conversations before or alongside work. Flexibility is common, and rules are often treated as guidelines rather than strict requirements. This creates a more informal, energetic atmosphere, where creativity and collaboration are encouraged. Decisions are often made through discussion and consensus, rather than following a strict hierarchy or timetable.</p>

                        <p>South African culture shares similarities with Spain in terms of social connection and flexibility. People value personal interaction, community, and informal communication. Relationships are important in daily life and in teamwork, and there is a balance between following plans and adapting to changing circumstances. Like in Spain, this creates a lively and adaptable environment, where collaboration and problem-solving often involve negotiation and discussion rather than strict rules.</p>

                        <p>Austria, on the other hand, combines structure and formality with a strong respect for tradition and quality. People value organization, punctuality, and precision, similar to the Netherlands, but with a slightly more formal and hierarchical tone. Work is approached in a systematic and methodical way, and there is a clear separation between professional and personal life. Hierarchies are respected, and decisions typically follow established procedures and expert input rather than spontaneous discussion.</p>

                        <p>Communication in the Netherlands tends to be direct and straightforward. People value clarity, honesty, and efficiency in how information is shared. In Spain, communication is generally warmer and more expressive. People use conversation to build relationships, and interactions often include humour, gestures, and personal anecdotes. Listening and dialogue are important for reaching agreement. In South Africa, communication is also friendly and relational, often combining directness with warmth and respect. People value mutual understanding and tend to adapt their tone depending on the situation. In Austria, communication is polite, respectful, and often more formal. People choose their words carefully and maintain a courteous tone, especially in professional settings. While honesty is appreciated, it is balanced with diplomacy to avoid conflict or misunderstanding.</p>

                        <p>Problem-solving and decision-making also differ between these cultures. In the Netherlands, issues are usually addressed quickly and pragmatically, with a focus on practical solutions. In Spain and South Africa, solutions are often negotiated through discussion and compromise, taking into account relationships and group harmony. This allows for flexibility and creativity but can take more time to reach a final decision. Austria leans toward careful analysis and thorough evaluation before acting. Decisions may take longer, as accuracy and long-term stability are prioritized over speed. The Austrian approach emphasizes precision, planning, and maintaining high standards in both process and outcome.</p>

                        <h2>What I learned:</h2>
                        <p>My time in Belgium was a transformative experience that bridged theoretical mathematics with practical AI applications. Over the three weeks, I learned not only the technical aspects of building and deploying machine learning models but also the critical importance of ethical considerations in AI development.</p>

                        <p>At the foundation was Python programming for AI - this was essential since we would be building our own models from scratch. I learned how to implement neural networks for time-series analysis, which gave us the mathematical and logical framework needed to process the constant stream of data coming from dam sensors. This was the first time I had to think about how the mathematical concepts I knew actually translated into functional code.</p>

                        <p>The module then progressed to more specialized areas. Natural Language Processing (NLP) introduced me to how AI can understand and generate human language, while Computer Vision became particularly important as it gave us the tools to analyze satellite imagery for detecting water hyacinth coverage. Learning deployment strategies taught me how to take models from experimental notebooks to functional applications that could actually be used by stakeholders.</p>

                        <p>A significant learning came from our discussions about AI Ethics. This helped me think critically about how automated systems are designed and the responsibility we have to ensure data is used fairly and transparently. I realized that technical success isn't the only goal; the impact on communities and stakeholders matters just as much.</p>

                        <p>The final project integration taught me how different AI models can work together in a multi-layered system. We built one model to analyze satellite images, another to process historical sensor data, and a third to combine these with weather data for final predictions. This experience showed me how adaptable analytical models need to be depending on context and data type.</p>

                        <p>Beyond technical skills, I learned the value of systematic validation, ethical design principles, and the importance of making AI solutions not just accurate but also responsible and deployable in real-world scenarios.</p>

                        <h2>My Contributions to the Project:</h2>
                        <p>I played a significant role in the technical development during the Belgium phase of our environmental monitoring project. My contributions spanned data acquisition, model development, and system integration.</p>

                        <p>My biggest contribution was building the entire model that analyzed historical sensor data to predict hyacinth growth. This involved processing time-series data from our IoT sensors, identifying patterns in hyacinth proliferation, and creating predictive algorithms that could forecast growth based on historical trends and current conditions.</p>

                        <p>I was also responsible for the "data hunt," where we had to find and prepare the diverse datasets needed for our AI models. This included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sourcing and preprocessing satellite imagery for our Computer Vision model</li>
                            <li>Collecting and cleaning historical weather data to correlate with hyacinth growth patterns</li>
                            <li>Integrating sensor records from our IoT systems into a format suitable for machine learning</li>
                            <li>Ensuring data quality and consistency across all sources</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In the final system integration, I worked on combining our different AI models into a cohesive multi-layered system. My historical sensor model served as one input to our final integrated model, which also incorporated satellite imagery analysis and current weather data to make accurate predictions about hyacinth coverage.</p>

                        <p>Beyond the technical coding and model development, I assisted the group in putting together the final presentation to ensure our findings were communicated clearly and effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences. This involved creating visualizations of our model outputs, explaining the methodology in accessible terms, and highlighting the practical implications of our work for environmental management.</p>

                        <p>My contributions helped ensure that our AI system was not only technically sound but also practically useful, with clear applications for monitoring and managing water hyacinth growth in dam environments.</p>

                            <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> Python with key libraries including TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, and NumPy</li>
                            <li><strong>AI Techniques:</strong> Neural Networks, Time-series Analysis, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> Satellite imagery, historical sensor data, weather records</li>
                            <li><strong>Development Environment:</strong> Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, local Python environments</li>
                            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Model serialization, API development, cloud integration strategies</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Why</h3>
                        <p>The purpose of this AI system was to create an automated solution for monitoring water hyacinth growth in dam environments. By combining satellite imagery analysis with sensor data processing, the system can provide early warnings of hyacinth proliferation, enabling timely intervention and reducing the ecological and economic impact of this invasive species.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How</h3>
                        <p>We followed a multi-layered AI approach:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Computer Vision Layer:</strong> Analyzed satellite imagery using convolutional neural networks to detect and quantify hyacinth coverage</li>
                            <li><strong>Time-series Analysis Layer:</strong> Processed historical sensor data to identify growth patterns and predict future proliferation</li>
                            <li><strong>Integration Layer:</strong> Combined outputs from both models with current weather data to make accurate predictions</li>
                            <li><strong>Deployment Layer:</strong> Prepared models for real-world application through appropriate deployment strategies</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>What</h3>
                        <p>By the end of the module, we had developed a functional multi-model AI system capable of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Detecting water hyacinth coverage from satellite imagery with significant accuracy</li>
                            <li>Predicting growth patterns based on historical sensor data</li>
                            <li>Integrating multiple data sources for comprehensive environmental monitoring</li>
                            <li>Providing actionable insights for dam management and hyacinth control</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>This was my first experience developing a complete AI solution from data acquisition through to model deployment. I learned how critical data quality is for AI performance, how different AI techniques can be combined for complex problems, and how ethical considerations must be integrated throughout the development process.</p>
